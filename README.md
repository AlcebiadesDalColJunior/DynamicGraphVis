Python implementation related to the paper, plus tools. Original paper presenting the approximation method: https://arxiv.org/abs/0912.3848 (Hammond et al)


### code:

- cmdWavelets.py: Command line tool to compute the wavelet coefficients, from an "edges" file and a "signal" file. Output is written by np.savetxt, nodes as rows, timeslices as columns.

- thiers2012.py: Script for the thiers2012 dataset, using all configuration options and tricks (use as base for more complex situations)

- util.py: Utility functions

### datasets:
- thiers2012, from http://www.sociopatterns.org/datasets/high-school-dynamic-contact-networks/
- simple : Synthetic test dataset for the command line tool


### File format:

- Edges: One time slice per line, edges separated by ";"  (n1,n2);(n2;n3);...;(na,nb)

- Signal: Identical to the edges file, but values instead of pairs.
